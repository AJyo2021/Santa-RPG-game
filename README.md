# Santa RPG Game

Welcome to the Santa RPG game project! Please note that this project is a work in progress, and some aspects may still need refinement. Here's an overview of the current status and what to expect:

## Status
- The game is under active development, and certain areas may experience segmentation faults during gameplay.
- You can find the executable to run the game in the `testgame` directory.
- I am currently working on creating a packaged build to improve the project's accessibility and stability.

## Get Involved
Feel free to fork this repository and experiment with the code. Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated as I continue to improve and enhance the game.

## License
I will be adding an open-source license to this project soon, so stay tuned for updates on licensing terms.

Thank you for your interest in the Santa RPG game project! I look forward to your involvement and hope you enjoy the game.
